To run these tests you must be in a web context, with Sitecore present.

Setup instructions:
1. Add a reference to this project in your Sitecore site
2. Add references to all of the assemblies in Dependencies/Libraries/WebTestRunner to your Sitecore site
3. Add the Synthesis.TestRunnerConfig.config to your App_Config\Include folder
4. Hit /synthesistests on your Sitecore site

The web test runner is Jorge Lusar's work: https://github.com/jorgelusar/sctestrunner
You can change the test running URL in the config file.

Any NUnit web test runner will also work, if you have one you prefer.
